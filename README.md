# SkipAds: A Project to Skip Sponsored Content in Videos  

## Problem Statement  

Sponsored segments in videos, while valuable to creators, can interrupt the viewing experience for users who prefer uninterrupted content. Identifying and skipping these segments manually is inconvenient and detracts from user satisfaction, especially when viewing multiple videos.  

## Solution  

SkipAds is a lightweight tool built using Python and Node.js that automates the process of skipping sponsored segments in videos. Optimized for all Chromium-based browsers, SkipAds ensures a seamless and distraction-free video-watching experience.

## Features  

- **Ad Skipping for Chromium Browsers**: Automatically skips predefined sponsored segments in videos across all Chromium-based browsers.  
- **Custom Rules**: Users can define specific time ranges to skip based on their preferences.  
- **Real-Time Integration**: Works with browser playback to ensure smooth transitions without pauses or delays.  
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Runs efficiently in the background without impacting system performance.

## Technology Stack  

- **Python**: Handles video segment processing and logic for skipping.  
- **Node.js**: Manages browser integration and user interaction settings.
